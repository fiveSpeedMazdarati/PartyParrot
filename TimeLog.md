|Week 1 | stayed in touch on Slack/GitHub, general parrot-ness|.25 | Luke | |
| 4/8/19 | decided uri's/added log4j/divvy'd tasks for the week | 2| team - in class | working with git branches, storing info in JSON instead of db |
| 4/9/19 | getting log4j out of master, added method that gets parrot based on name   | 4.5| Heidi | still fumbling with git branching a little, tried to research method to get info from JSON file more directly instead of making a collection of all the parrots every time (no luck). Also based on this log maybe I'm slow! |
| 4/10/19|categories returns json results | .5| Kelly||
| 4/12/19 | add new parrot feature | 2.5 | Luke | spent a bunch of time writing code and troublshooting the location of json file. I never did figure out how to get to the thing. Team work time should help find the solution since I think it's just a project structure thing.|
| 4/13/19 | adds get categories feature, loads properties file, adds test shell | 3 | Heidi | Still have questions about how to use the properties file more efficiently; also not sure how to set up a test-specific json data file. Did not research the latter much.|
| 4/16/19 | resolved file read/write problem, changed file path, updated code to use properties file|2|Luke| learned a metric ton about Linux file structure and permissions|
| 4/17/19 | added POST service request to consume form params, refactored both POST request methods to share common code, built quick form to test new POST request, troubleshoot improper tomee shutdown/startup on AWS | Luke | 3 | consuming form params is pretty neat. I like writing code, but I don't like troubleshooting the tools.|
